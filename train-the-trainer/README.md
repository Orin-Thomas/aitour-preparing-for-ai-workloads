## How To Use

Welcome,

As an experienced presenter, we know you know HOW to present so this guide will focus on WHAT you need to present. It provides you an extended run-through of the presentation created by the presentation design team. 

Along with the video of the presentation, this document will link to all the assets you need to successfully present including PowerPoint slides and video demonstrations. As these demos take some time, sometimes requiring waits of up to 15 minutes, you will narrate the silent video versions. A narrated version of each demo, taken from the longform video presentation, is also provided so you can quickly refresh on each demo without having to navigate through the entire presentation video. As an FYI the deployment is a single Azure OpenAI instance and a single Azure ML instance. The Azure OpenAI instance has GPT-4o-mini deployed as a model. This deployment is relatively simple and can be accomplished in a trial Azure subscription if you want to interact with it - though be aware that leaving the deployment in place will incur costs.

1.  Read document in its entirety.
2.  Watch the video presentation
3.  Ask questions of the Lead Presenter
